# django_portfolio_website
This was a small learning exercise undertaken by me after some self-learning.
I have created my own small-portfolio website using Django framework with PostgreSQL as the DB.
I haven't hosted this website anywhere, the short demo video is available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LME1LipGKSE
